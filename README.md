# 4ZP6A/B Capstone - Procgen


## Setup Instructions:

1. Update to latest version of **Unity**:  https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update
2. Once repo set up locally, download **git LFS** (https://git-lfs.github.com/) and run this in your local repository:  *git lfs install*
3. Download **Steam** and **SteamVR** *(under Library->Tools in Steam)*:  https://store.steampowered.com/about/
4. Launch Unity project and **'Accept All'** SteamVR Unity settings suggestions. 

For actual usage, you need to have SteamVR hooked up properly with Vive for everything to work together.


## Unity Usage Notes:

1. Make sure to start Steam / SteamVR on the lab machine
2. Open Unity only after Steam / SteamVR is up and running
3. Ignore IVRRenderModel errors on local machines - this is due to the fact no VR setup is hooked up and they will resolve themselves once they're running on the lab computer.
4. DO NOT commit .../SteamVR/ git diffs
