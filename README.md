## Project Setup Instructions
1. Update to latest version of **Unity**:  https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update
2. Once repo set up locally, download **git LFS** (https://git-lfs.github.com/) and run this in your local repository:  *git lfs install*
3. Download **Steam** and **SteamVR** *(under Library->Tools in Steam)*:  https://store.steampowered.com/about/
4. Launch Unity project and **'Accept All'** SteamVR Unity settings suggestions. 

For actual usage, you need to have SteamVR hooked up properly with Vive for everything to work together.


## Unity Usage Notes
1. Start Steam / SteamVR on development machine
2. Open Unity only after Steam / SteamVR is up and running
3. Ignore IVRRenderModel errors on local machines without SteamVR or a VR rig - they will resolve themselves once they're running on a machine with the required hardware and software.
