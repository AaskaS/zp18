%% What we could do is include hyperlinks to the classes we mention on GitHub so they
%% could immediately jump to where we're talking about / make the changes they want to

\section*{Overview}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Scene Components}
\subsection*{VR Equipment Interface} % Headset, controllers -> mapping to unity world (virtual hands, etc)

\subsection*{Core Task Functionality} % Bucket, tap, flow manager, destination, limiters, drainage...

\subsection*{Tutorials \& Instructions} % Triggers/markers, object destruction/moving through steps

\subsection*{Receiving Treatment} % Medication station, pills/pedestals/UI, how they are used

\subsection*{Other Features} % Curtains for motion sickness, door for claustrophobia, audio,....


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Script Components}
\subsection*{Interactivity} % Virtual hands, camera behaviour, picking up things (vyome's stuff)

\subsection*{Immersion} % Audio, haptic feedback, etc

\subsection*{Experiment Setup} % Configuration classes / days / SimManager -> state tracking, etc , participant data

\subsection{Task Design}
\subsubsection*{Task Framework} % how the participant can actually do the task. i.e. flow manager, drainage, etc.
\subsubsection*{Impairment} % how we actually coded each impairment, how they get changed per day, etc (sim man)
\subsubsection*{Offering Treatment} % how do we present info / code costs, etc etc / determine which panels to show
\subsubsection*{Receiving Treatment} % how do they trigger an obtain attempt, what happens on a successful attempt
\subsubsection*{Instructions} % Tutorial framework, how it's coded -> beginning + mid-way via limbo / treatments

\subsection*{Custom Configuration} % Aaska's stuff -> using the config file/parsing
